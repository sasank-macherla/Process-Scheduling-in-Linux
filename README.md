# Process-Scheduling-in-Linux
This project deals with the Process Scheduling in Linux and how it chooses among the five scheduling algorithms.


Process Scheduling is the essential part of the Multi-programming operating system. In order to keep the CPU busy i.e., to increase the CPU utilization, the Operating System context switches the process with other runnable processes using several scheduling algorithms. Operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing. Like any time sharing system, Linux achieves the magical effect of an apparent simultaneous execution of multiple processes by switching from one process to another in a very short time frame. In this project we explore about the Linux scheduler operation and understand how it chooses among the various scheduling algorithms like First-in First-out (FIFO), Round Robin (RR) and Priority Based Scheduling.
